# Welcome to the M2 Direct Project

Check out the [project wiki](https://bitbucket.org/rbmglobal/2mdirect/wiki/Home) for information about the resident projects.

We are using a git repository for source code control. There are two branches **master** and **develop**.

All development will take place in **develop**.  Take a look at [source code strategy outlined here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

You will clone the repository onto your local machine.
You will checkout the **develop** branch and do your work there.
You will commit changes to your local repo and then push those changes to the origin server **develop** branch only.
You commits will be small and incremental. There will be 1 commit related to 1 issue
 and add comments referring to **issues**
