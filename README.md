# Welcome to the M2 Direct Project

Check out the [project wiki](https://bitbucket.org/rbmglobal/2mdirect/wiki/Home) for information about the resident projects.

We are using a git repository for source code control. There are two branches **master** and **develop**.

All development will take place in **develop**.  Take a look at [source code strategy outlined here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

* You will clone the repository onto your local machine.
* You will checkout the **develop** branch and do your work there.
* You will commit changes to your local repo and then push those changes to the origin server **develop** branch only.
* Your commits will be small and incremental. The best practice is to match 1 commit to 1 issue/task.
* Your commit messages will refer the issue/task addressed in the commit. If an issue/task does not exist, you will create one so the commit can be tracked properly. The best practice is to match 1 commit to 1 issue/task.
* Take a look at the [Bitbucket documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Resolve+issues+automatically+when+users+push+code) to see how to format your commit messages to refer to an issue/task.
